                    I'm Chris Khalife and I upload bass videos to YouTube under the name "My Bassist Chris". I have been uploading videos for nine years and have been playing bass for fourteen years. My first instrument I learned at the age of nine was piano, but transitioned to guitar at age twelve and bass shortly after. I chose the name My Bassist Chris for two reasons: To pay homage to my favorite band My Chemical Romance and because being a bassist in many bands people would refer to me as my bassist Chris.
