                <p>I'm Chris Khalife and I upload bass videos to YouTube under the name "My Bassist Chris". I have been uploading videos for nine years and have been playing bass for fourteen years. My first instrument I learned at the age of nine was piano, but transitioned to guitar at age twelve and bass shortly after. I chose the name My Bassist Chris for two reasons: To pay homage to my favorite band My Chemical Romance and because being a bassist in many bands people would refer to me as my bassist Chris.

                <p>I strive to make my bass covers as accurate as possible. I strongly believe it extremely challenging to play a studio bass line note for note as opposed to a cover that is 90% accurate. While my channel first started as purely bass covers, I eventually started making videos on bass gear. I have a huge addiction to buying pedals for bass and love to demonstrate all of pedals I have collected over the years.
